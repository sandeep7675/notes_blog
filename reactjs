u need nodejs and npm to create react applicaiton

node js can be installed 3 ways 
1. ubuntu repo
2. add ppa and can install latest version and specific verison u want. This will npm as well
3. using nvm (node version manager)


If you've previously installed create-react-app globally, it is recommended that you uninstall the package to ensure npx always uses the latest version of create-react-app.

To uninstall, run this command: npm uninstall -g create-react-app.

To run the application : 
cd my-react-app

npm start
